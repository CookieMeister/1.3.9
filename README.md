Semester 1 Final
Here is some sample code that you may 'fork' to create your own program to complete the Semester 1 final project.  You may use any resources that you find on the web and more than one group may collaborate on completing the code portion of this project.  Each team will still be required to complete the packet and submit the deliverables as indicated on page 2 of the 1.3.9 packet.
